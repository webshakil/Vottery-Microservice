Security Implementation Strategy
3. What to Hash vs Encrypt in Milestone-1

Hash (One-way, SHA-256 with salt):

    Passwords (if using email/password auth)
    Biometric templates/hashes
    OTP codes in database
    Device fingerprints
    Audit log entries

Encrypt (Two-way, AES-256):

    PII data in database (email, phone, names)
    Session tokens
    Biometric raw data (before hashing)
    Sensitive device information
    JWT payload sensitive data

Digital Signatures (SHA-256 + RSA):

    API requests between microservices
    Critical database operations
    Audit trail entries
    Token generation/verification

4. Milestone-1 Security Implementation Priorities

Phase 1A (Week 1-2): Core Encryption

    AES-256 encryption for database PII fields
    SHA-256 hashing for biometric data
    Basic JWT with RS256 signing
    HTTPS enforcement

Phase 1B (Week 3): Advanced Security

    RSA/ElGamal for end-to-end encryption
    Digital signatures for inter-service communication
    Threshold decryption setup
    OWASP compliance implementation

Phase 1C (Week 4): Protection & Validation

    Rate limiting middleware
    DDoS protection
    Input validation framework
    Security audit and testing

Service Communication Flow

Frontend Request → API Gateway → Auth Service
                                     ↓
                  Biometric Service ← (API call for biometric processing)
                                     ↓
                  Database ← (encrypted storage)
                                     ↓
                  Auth Service → JWT Response

Questions for You:

    Service Communication: Should biometric service expose REST APIs that auth service calls, or use message queues/events?
    Database Strategy: Separate databases per service or shared PostgreSQL with service-specific schemas?
    Key Management: Should each service have its own encryption keys or centralized key management?
    Biometric Storage: Store biometric hashes in biometric service DB or shared user database?
    Session Management: Where should device-session linking be handled - Auth service or Biometric service?

Once we align on these architectural decisions, I can provide the proper implementation with correct service separation and security layers.

What's your preference for these design choices?

answers question 1. decide by yourself according to milestone. question 2. just one shared shared PostgreSQL database with service-specific schemas. question 3. decide best practice


Based on the milestone requirements and best practices, here are my architectural decisions:
Architectural Decisions
1. Service Communication: REST APIs between services (simpler for Milestone-1, can evolve to message queues later)
3. Key Management: Centralized key management service with per-service key rotation
4. Biometric Storage: Biometric hashes in shared DB under biometric service schema for easier cross-service queries
5. Session Management: Auth service handles sessions, Biometric service handles device-biometric linking
Implementation Strategy
What I'm providing:

Biometric Service (dedicated microservice)
Device detection and fingerprinting
Biometric data capture/processing
Encrypted storage with proper hashing
Cross-platform support (Web, iOS, Android)

What gets HASHED (SHA-256 with salt):

Biometric templates
Device fingerprints
Credential IDs

What gets ENCRYPTED (AES-256):

Device details (browser, OS info)
IP addresses
Location data
